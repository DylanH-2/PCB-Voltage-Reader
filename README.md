# Custom PCB-Voltage-Reader
The project I designed was my own custom 4-layer PCB built in KiCad to measure volatage across various components. It works as a voltage reader/divider capable of tracking battery levels and voltage drop-offs passing through different circuits. 

# Hardware Features
* 10kΩ resistor
* 30kΩ resistor
* Two double pin headers
* Top layer with the copper tracks and compnents
* Front and back layer with a GND plane
* Easy access to pins and has silkscreen labels
